# Stop Touching Face
Stop Touching Face is a web application designed to help users avoid touching their faces. The app uses custom voice alerts to warn users whenever their hands come near their faces. Users can train the AI by clicking "start" and "next" to capture and learn their specific gestures. Once trained, the app actively monitors and warns users whenever they attempt to touch their face, promoting healthier habits and reducing the risk of transferring germs.
